class ObjectAwareRandomCrop(DualTransform):
    """
    Random crop that ensures at least one keypoint is included, with stitch-aware positioning.

    Designed for training models that will run inference with a sliding-window stitcher.
    The crop position is chosen so the selected keypoint can land anywhere in the crop —
    including near edges — matching the distribution the model will see during tiled inference.

    Why translation diversity matters: HerdNet runs inference in fixed 512x512 tiles at
    stride=392. If training crops over-represent any sub-tile position (especially the
    centre), the model learns a position prior tied to that location and at inference
    only fires when the stitcher's grid happens to align an iguana there. With 80% drone
    overlap, that grid alignment varies randomly across consecutive frames, producing
    erratic detection patterns. See investigation in
    `metashape_mosaicing/tests/center_bias_proof.png`.

    With the recommended defaults (`min_edge_distance=0`, `translation_jitter=0`) the
    selected keypoint is uniformly distributed in the crop — that's the right setting
    for stitcher compatibility. Use `translation_jitter` to add extra position noise
    on top, which is robust to subtle centre-bias paths in callers that pass
    `min_edge_distance > 0`.

    Args:
        height (int): Height of the crop.
        width (int): Width of the crop.
        min_edge_distance (int): Minimum distance in pixels between THE SELECTED keypoint and
            crop edge. Set to 0 for uniform placement (recommended for stitcher compatibility).
            Default: 0.
        empty_probability (float): Probability of creating a crop without any keypoints
            (pure background). Default: 0.0.
        edge_probability (float): Probability of deliberately placing the selected keypoint
            in the edge zone (within `edge_zone` pixels of the crop border). This trains the
            model to be confident at tile boundaries during stitched inference. Default: 0.0.
        edge_zone (int): Width of the edge zone in pixels. Should match the stitcher overlap
            (e.g. 120px for overlap=120). Only used when edge_probability > 0. Default: 120.
        max_attempts (int): Maximum attempts to find a valid crop. Default: 10.
        translation_jitter (int): After picking a crop position, perturb it by a uniform
            integer in [-translation_jitter, +translation_jitter] on each axis. Clamped to
            keep ≥1 keypoint inside the crop and the crop inside the image. Defaults to 0
            (no extra jitter). Setting this to ~stride/2 of your inference stitcher
            (e.g. 196 for the iguana config's stride=392) explicitly randomises the
            sub-tile position so the model can't latch onto any particular position prior.
            Recommended when min_edge_distance > 0 or when retraining a model that's
            shown centre-fixation pathology at inference.
        always_apply (bool): Whether to always apply this transform. Default: False.
        p (float): Probability of applying the transform. Default: 1.0.
