# Phase 4 — B4 with native `density_aware_fmo03_aux` loss

> ⚠️ **Seed-sensitivity caveat (added retrospectively after 3-seed replication)**: The "native loss is worse" conclusion below is based on seed=42, where the override beat native by F1 +0.015 / MAE +0.42. At seed=123 the gap shrank (F1 +0.012 / MAE +0.17). At seed=7 the override actually *lost* on both metrics (F1 −0.009 / MAE +0.33). **Across 3 seeds, mean F1 is 0.945 (override) vs 0.939 (native) — within noise.** Mean MAE still favours override (0.89 vs 0.97), so the production counting recommendation holds, but the F1 conclusion below should be read as "native is approximately equal to override on F1" rather than "native is worse". See [Phase 5](phase5_seed_replication.md) for the full 3-seed picture.

## Hypothesis

[Phase 3](phase3_backbone_threshold.md) ran B4 (`fmo03_full_v2_bifpn`) with `losses=herdnet_fmo03` overridden — same loss as every other backbone for clean ablation. That handicap removed the gradient signal from B4's `aux_p3` and `aux_p4` heads (which `herdnet_fmo03` doesn't reference). Even handicapped, B4 produced the best results of the phase: F1 0.955 @ ts=0.50, MAE 0.75 @ ts=0.35.

The natural follow-up: B4's *native* loss is `density_aware_fmo03_aux` (DensityAware + weighted CE + aux FocalLoss on P3 λ=0.3 and P4 λ=0.1). With aux gradients flowing, the deep-supervision intuition says intermediate FPN levels should learn richer representations and the final detector should improve. **Phase 4 tests this.**

## Setup

Identical to Phase 3 B4 except for the loss:

| Variable | Phase 3 B4 | Phase 4 B4 |
|---|---|---|
| Backbone / config | `fmo03_full_v2_bifpn` (`CamouflageHerdNetConvNeXtV2`, BiFPN + DeformConv) | same |
| Dataset | `fmo03_new_objcrop_augplus` | same |
| Epochs / bs / seed | 30 / 4 / 42 | same |
| **Loss** | `herdnet_fmo03` (FocalLoss + weighted CE) — **override** | `density_aware_fmo03_aux` — **native** |
| Aux heads | trained but ignored by loss (no gradient) | actively supervised (λ=0.3 on P3, λ=0.1 on P4) |
| GPU peak memory | ~3 GiB | 9.3 GiB (aux gradients) |

## Per-epoch metrics (cropped val — convergence tracking)

| | per-epoch best F1 | precision | recall | MAE |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Phase 3 B4 (override) | **0.9459** | 0.9651 | 0.9274 | **0.11** |
| Phase 4 B4 (native) | 0.9318 | 0.9480 | 0.9162 | 0.16 |

Phase 4 already loses on per-epoch by 1.4 pts F1 and +0.05 MAE. (This time per-epoch was a faithful predictor — see "What this tells us" below.)

## Phase 4b — full-size eval at default `adapt_ts=0.30`

```
tag         F1      P       R       MAE     RMSE    AP
Phase 3 B4  0.934   0.929   0.939   0.83    1.22    0.933
Phase 4 B4  0.925   0.933   0.917   1.25    1.66    0.916
Δ           -0.009  +0.004  -0.022  +0.42   +0.44   -0.017
```

Native loses every operating-point metric except a 0.4 pt precision uptick. MAE is +0.42 worse — already a meaningful regression.

## Phase 4c — threshold sweep

| ts | F1 | precision | recall | MAE | RMSE | AP |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0.05 | 0.547 | 0.384 | 0.956 | 22.50 | 23.59 | 0.951 |
| 0.10 | 0.821 | 0.723 | 0.950 | 4.75 | 5.59 | 0.946 |
| 0.15 | 0.883 | 0.833 | 0.939 | 2.08 | 2.57 | 0.937 |
| 0.20 | 0.909 | 0.885 | 0.934 | 1.50 | 1.91 | 0.932 |
| **0.25** | 0.923 | 0.918 | 0.928 | **1.17** | 1.41 | 0.926 |
| 0.30 | 0.925 | 0.933 | 0.917 | 1.25 | 1.66 | 0.916 |
| 0.35 | 0.927 | 0.938 | 0.917 | 1.33 | 1.68 | 0.916 |
| 0.40 | 0.924 | 0.948 | 0.901 | 1.42 | 1.71 | 0.900 |
| **0.50** | **0.940** | 0.982 | 0.901 | 1.58 | 1.89 | 0.900 |
| 0.60 | 0.939 | 0.988 | 0.895 | 1.75 | 2.06 | 0.895 |
| 0.70 | 0.939 | 0.988 | 0.895 | 1.75 | 2.06 | 0.895 |

## Best operating points — Phase 4 vs Phase 3 B4

| Goal | Phase 3 B4 (override) | Phase 4 B4 (native) | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| Best F1 | **0.955** @ ts=0.50 (P=0.977, R=0.934, MAE=0.83) | 0.940 @ ts=0.50 (P=0.982, R=0.901, MAE=1.58) | F1 −0.015, MAE +0.75 |
| Best MAE | **0.75** @ ts=0.35 (F1=0.942) | 1.17 @ ts=0.25 (F1=0.923) | MAE +0.42, F1 −0.019 |
| Recall @ P ≥ 0.85 | **0.956** @ ts=0.20 (P=0.883) | 0.934 @ ts=0.20 (P=0.885) | R −0.022 |

**Phase 3 B4 (handicapped) wins every operating point.** Native is worse on F1 by 0.015, on MAE by 0.42 (more than half a iguana per frame), on recall at high precision by 0.022.

## What this tells us

**The DensityAware reweighting hurts calibration on this architecture too**, not just on convnext_baseline. Phase 2 showed it on a plain ConvNeXt; Phase 4 reproduces the same effect on BiFPN+DeformConv. The pattern: density-weighted pixels (cluster regions) get pushed to high confidence, generating high-confidence false positives at the operating point. This time the additional aux deep-supervision didn't compensate.

**Deep-supervision aux heads alone aren't a free lunch.** With the same architecture and dataset, adding gradient signal to `aux_p3` and `aux_p4` produced *worse* end metrics (per-epoch F1 0.932 vs 0.946 with aux heads frozen). Possible reasons:

1. The aux losses are weighted relative to the main loss (`λ_p3=0.3, λ_p4=0.1`) and trained simultaneously. The optimisation problem is harder (4 loss terms vs 2), and on a 30-epoch budget the joint optimum may not match the main-only optimum the override variant found.
2. The DensityAware main loss already concentrates training signal on cluster pixels via the 0.5×–3.0× weight. Compounding that with aux losses on intermediate FPN levels may have over-emphasised cluster regions further.
3. The aux heads' outputs are interpolated to match heatmap size and supervised against the *same* target. If the aux supervision encourages multiple FPN levels to fire on the same locations, the final heatmap may have more spurious high-confidence peaks (matching what we see — F1 only 0.940 even at ts=0.50 because precision rises to 0.982 but recall caps at 0.901).

**Per-epoch was a faithful signal here.** That's worth noting against the pattern of Phases 1–3, where per-epoch lied. Phase 4's per-epoch F1 was 0.014 below Phase 3 B4's; full-size eval confirmed the gap (0.015 F1 at best). Probably because both runs share the same architecture and dataset; the only difference is the loss, and its effect propagates consistently from cropped val to full-size val.

**AP doesn't hide the regression** here, unlike Phase 2 L2. Phase 4 AP at default = 0.916, vs Phase 3 B4's 0.933. The native loss didn't even produce a stronger ranker — it produced a worse one *and* worse calibration.

## Recommendations

1. **Drop the Phase 3 follow-up suggestion to use native loss for B4.** Phase 4 falsifies it. The previous recommendation in [phase3 doc](phase3_backbone_threshold.md) under "Suggested Phase 4" was wrong; the native config underperforms.
2. **`herdnet_fmo03` (Focal + weighted CE) is the production loss** across all backbones tested so far. Phase 2 (convnext_baseline), Phase 3 (5 backbones with override), and now Phase 4 (B4 native is worse) all support this.
3. **The Phase 3 production recommendations stand**:
   - Default operating point: B4 + `adapt_ts=0.35` → F1=0.942, MAE=0.75
   - Detection benchmark: B4 + `adapt_ts=0.50` → F1=0.955
   - Zero-FP screening: B3 + `adapt_ts=0.70` → P=1.000, F1=0.942
4. **Don't bother running Phase 4-style native-loss experiments on B3 or B5.** B3's native is `density_aware_fmo03` (no aux); we already established density-aware loses to Focal+CE in Phase 2. B5's native is the same. The pattern is consistent: density-aware loss hurts at the operating point, no aux heads change that.

## Caveats

- This is a single seed (42) per configuration. Phase 4 lost by 0.015 F1 — within the range that 3-seed variance might cover. If seed variance matters, re-run both Phase 3 B4 and Phase 4 B4 with seeds {42, 123, 7}. But the +0.42 MAE gap is much harder to explain by seed noise.
- The Phase 4 trainer's GPU peak memory was 9.3 GiB vs ~3 GiB for the override variant — the aux heads more than tripled memory. If memory ever becomes a constraint, this is another point against the native config.
